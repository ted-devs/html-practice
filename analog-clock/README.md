# Analog Clock
I practised creating an analog clock by following [this](https://youtu.be/4ul3q-cEhvU) youtube tutorial.

## What I learned
- **Variables in CSS** - This tutorial defines variables in html and modifies them in css. One benefit of doing so is that you can have the same variable identifier which can have different values, and this makes your css simpler.
- **Calulations in CSS** - This tutorial uses the `calc()` to calculate the rotation required for the numbers around the clock and also on their own axis for correct orientation.
- **Transformations in CSS** - This tutorial uses `rotate()` as the value for transform property to position the numbers on the clock.
- **Date class in JS** - This tutorial get the current date, and calculates the rotation in degrees required after every second. The Date class has many methods that makes retrieving values convenient.
- **Style manipulation in JS** - This tutorial modifies the transform of the hand elements for the clock function. The degrees of rotation is calculated every 1000 milliseconds and then assigned to the transform property.
